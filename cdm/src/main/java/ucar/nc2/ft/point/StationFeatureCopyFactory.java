 * A factory for making deep copies of StationPointFeature, so all data is self contained.
 * A factory will use the first StationPointFeature to get the StructureMembers object, and the DateUnits, and uses that for all copies.
 * So all StationPointFeature must have the same StructureMembers and DateUnit.
 * It will keep a hashmap of Stations, and reuse the Station object.
